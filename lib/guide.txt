To ensure that the app functions properly even if the API is not working, follow these steps:

1- Go to https://webhook.site/.
2- Create a temporary link using the data from the ' apiData.txt ' file.
3- Copy the generated temporary link.
4- Paste the copied temporary link inside the ' getProductModel() ' function in the ' home.dart ' file of your app.

This process will allow your app to use the temporary link generated from webhook.site.
